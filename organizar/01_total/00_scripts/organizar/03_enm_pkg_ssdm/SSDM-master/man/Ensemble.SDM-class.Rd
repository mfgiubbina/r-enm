\title{An S4 class to represent an ensemble SDM}
\description{
This is an S4 class to represent an ensemble SDM from multiple algorithms
(including generalized linear model, general additive model, multivariate
adaptive splines, generalized boosted regression model, classification tree
analysis, random forest, maximum entropy, artificial neural network, and
support vector machines). This S4 class is returned by
\code{\link{ensemble_modelling}} or \code{\link{ensemble}}.

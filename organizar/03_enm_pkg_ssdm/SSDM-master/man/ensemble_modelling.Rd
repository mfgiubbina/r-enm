 \code{\link{plot.model}} function.
}
\description{
Build an ensemble SDM that assembles multiple algorithms for a single species.
The function takes as inputs an occurrence data frame made of presence/absence
or presence-only records and a raster object for data extraction and
projection. The function returns an S4 \linkS4class{Ensemble.SDM} class object
containing the habitat suitability map, the binary map, the between-algorithm
variance map and the associated evaluation tables (model evaluation, algorithm
evaluation, algorithm correlation matrix and variable importance).

 reference).} \item{cv}{\strong{Cross-validation} method used to split the
 occurrence dataset used for evaluation: \strong{holdout} data are

 times, \strong{k-fold} data are partitioned into k (\emph{cv.param[1]})

 (Leave One Out) each point is successively taken as evaluation data.}
 \item{metric}{Choice of the metric used to compute the binary map threshold
 and the confusion matrix (by default SES as recommended by Liu et al.
 (2005), see reference below): \strong{Kappa} maximizes the Kappa,

 \strong{TSS} (True Skill Statistic) maximizes the sum of sensitivity and
 specificity, \strong{SES} uses the sensitivity-specificity equality,
 \strong{LW} uses the lowest occurrence prediction probability, \strong{ROC}

 characteristic curve) and the upper left corner
